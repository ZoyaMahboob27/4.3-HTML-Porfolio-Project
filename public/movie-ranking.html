    <h1>The Best Movies According to Xlayfer</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
    <p>
      Haku is a hottie and I really do love how deeply connected to my childhood
      this movie is.

    <h3>Legally Blonde</h3>
    <p>
      Elle is an icon and the fact that she was 4.0, valedictorian, went to
      Harvard Law school AND was pretty pretty much sums up why I love this
      movie.
    </p>

    <h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
    <p>
      Although it was a scary movie when I was younger it is a really good movie
      with which I have a lot of fond memories.
